# Solution

The program expects 3 numbers as the input, and then runs three functions to check each of them.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/three_trials/1.png" description="Decompilation of the main function" %}

Our goal is to get to the function in the `else` statement, which means the values of `cVar1`, `cVar2`, `cVar3` must be non 0.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/three_trials/2.png" description="The function in the else statement above" %}

So we'll just need to reverse the three functions! Easy, right? XD

## First trial
```c
local_14 = 0;
local_10 = param_1;
while (0 < local_10) {
  dVar2 = (double)FUN_0010173c((ulong)(uint)(local_10 % 10),3);
  local_14 = (int)(dVar2 + (double)local_14);
  local_10 = local_10 / 10;
}
if (((local_14 == param_1) && (400 < param_1)) && (param_1 < 1000)) {
  uVar1 = 1;
}
else {
  uVar1 = 0;
}
return uVar1;
```

We want this to return a non-zero value, which is 1. It should be quite obvious that it wants the sum of cube of digits of the argument to be equal to the argument itself.

An example:

$\text{sum of cube of digits of } 123 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 36$
{: .notice}

Also, we know that our input is between 400 and 1000, so we can easily write a brute force for that. Solution in python:

```python
for i in range(401, 1000):
    res = 0
    tmp = i
    while tmp > 0:
        res += (tmp%10)**3
        tmp //= 10
    if i == res:
        print(i)
        return
```

## Second trial
```c
dVar3 = (double)FUN_0010173c((ulong)param_1,2); // this directly calls the C function pow()
iVar1 = (int)dVar3;
local_20 = 0;
dVar3 = (double)FUN_0010173c((ulong)param_1,2); // so this is the same as pow(param_1, 2) too
local_1c = (int)dVar3;
while (0 < local_1c) {
  local_20 = local_20 + 1;
  local_1c = local_1c / 10;
}
if ((local_20 - (local_20 >> 0x1f) & 1U) + (local_20 >> 0x1f) != 1) {
  local_18 = 1;
  while ((int)local_18 < local_20) {
    dVar3 = (double)FUN_0010173c(10,(ulong)local_18);
    if (iVar1 % (int)dVar3 + iVar1 / (int)dVar3 == param_1) {
      uVar2 = FUN_0010173c(10,9); // pow(10, 9)
      return uVar2 & 0xffffffffffffff00 | (ulong)(extraout_XMM0_Qa < (double)iVar1);
    }
    local_18 = local_18 + 1;
  }
}
return 0;
```

`local_20` is counting the number of digits in the square of `param_1` (notice the `pow(param_1, 2)`), so `local_20 >> 0x1f` will always be 0 since our input is only an `int`. So the if statement is basically

```c
if (local_20 != 1) { ...
```

Then inside the while loop, it is basically checking whether a given input n has

$n^2 \% 10^k + n^2 / 10^k == n$
{: .notice}

for some valid k. Notice that `n*n` should be greater than `1e9` as seen from the return statement inside the while loop. So this is another easy brute force then:

```python
for i in range(4, 2**31):
    if i*i <= 10**9: continue
    if i*i >= 2**31: break

    dig = 0
    sq = i*i
    while sq > 0:
        dig += 1
        sq //= 10

    sq = i*i
    for j in range(1, dig):
        if sq%(10**j) + sq//(10**j) == i:
            print(i)
            return
```

## Third trial
```c
local_10 = 0;
local_c = 1;
while (local_c <= param_1) {
  if ((param_1 % local_c == 0) && (local_c != param_1)) {
    local_10 = local_10 + local_c;
  }
  local_c = local_c + 1;
}
if (((local_10 == param_1) && (dVar1 = (double)FUN_0010173c(10,5), dVar1 < (double)local_10)) &&
   (dVar1 = (double)FUN_0010173c(10,8), (double)local_10 < dVar1)) {
  return 1;
}
return 0;
```

One sentence to summarize this final test: A number in between `1e5` and `1e8`, where the sum of its proper divisors is equal to itself.

A normal brute force will not work as the complexity will be `O(nâˆšn)`, and for `n = 1e8`, this will take too long to complete. Luckily I found [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/167288/sum-of-proper-divisors-of-every-number-up-to-n) that proposes a solution of complexity `O(n log log n)`.

```python
result = sum_divisors(10**8)
for i in range(10**5 + 1, 10**8):
    if result[i]-i == i:
        print(i)
        return
```
Using the `sum_divisors` function from the link above.

# Final Script
```python
def cond1():
    for i in range(401, 1000):
        res = 0
        tmp = i
        while tmp > 0:
            res += (tmp%10)**3
            tmp //= 10
        if i == res:
            print(i, end='-')
            return

def cond2():
    for i in range(4, 2**31):
        if i*i <= 10**9: continue
        if i*i >= 2**31: break

        dig = 0
        sq = i*i
        while sq > 0:
            dig += 1
            sq //= 10
        sq = i*i
        for j in range(1, dig):
            if sq%(10**j) + sq//(10**j) == i:
                print(i, end='-')
                return

def cond3():
    result = sum_divisors(10**8)
    for i in range(10**5 + 1, 10**8):
        if result[i]-i == i:
            print(i)
            return

def sum_divisors(n):
    result = [1] * n
    result[0] = 0
    for p in range(2, n):
        if result[p] == 1: # p is prime
            p_power, last_m = p, 1
            while p_power < n:
                m = last_m + p_power
                for i in range(p_power, n, p_power):
                    result[i] //= last_m    # (B)
                    result[i] *= m          # (B)
                last_m = m
                p_power *= p
    return result

cond1()
cond2()
cond3()
```

This code takes around 5 minutes or so to run.

## Output
```
407-38962-33550336
```

Then, we put `407-38962-33550336` into SHA256 and we get our flag!
